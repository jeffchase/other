Objects are a specific part of the world state. They occupy a specific
space.

Agents have an internal state and a set of actions. The can also
observe, creating some potentially noisy and probably limited record
of the state of the world.

Automated agents have a way to assign value to observed states and
models for how their actions might impact the world state.

Live agents have internal processes that continually modify their
internal state.

Physical agents have objects that are exposed for manipulation and
observation by other agents.

Animals have a body and vitality. They are capable of specific kinds
of actions and observations. Actions are inherently fuzzy. A skill
makes an action more precise.

A ability is a specific action that has a specific intended effect on
the state of the world (including other physical agents). The actual
effect may be different from the intended effect based on the
ability's skill (accuracy). An ability may also have an effect on the
agent itself.

A skill may be based on calibration. By repeating an action with an
intended effect and observing the actual effect the ability may be
calibrated to get more accurate over time.
